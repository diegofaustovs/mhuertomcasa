    'competition' => 'The Solar Decathlon is an international competition created by the U.S. Department of Energy in which universities from all over the world work to design, build and operate a grid-connected, an energetically self-sufficient house, that uses solar energy as the only energy source and that is equipped with all of the technologies that enable maximum energy efficiency. <br>The Rules are intended to encourage competition prototype houses that meet a triple challenge: energy, environment, and society. Therefore, the evaluation of proposed projects, via the 10 contests of the Decathlon, are intended to address disparate issues related to houses of the future. <br> The Solar Decathlon Latin America & Caribbean 2015 Rules will focus on encouraging designs that address the following four principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Housing</li>
<li>Urban Density</li>
<li>Rational use of environmental  resources</li>
